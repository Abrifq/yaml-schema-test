# Yaml as JSON-Schema Testing Ground

Why not?

Seriously, why not? We parse YAML into JSON objects anyway.

## Testing

Use this fork of v8r: [Abrifq's fork of v8r](https://github.com/Abrifq/v8r)

```bash
npx github:Abrifq/v8r usage.yaml --schema schema.yaml
```

## Disclaimers and references

I'll be using [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org)'s tutorial schema, 
converting with an online YAML-to-JSON converter from [transform.tools](https://transform.tools/json-to-yaml)
